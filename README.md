# Custom-Tracking-App

The plan is to make an android app that allows users to track whatever they want hence the custom aspect


## Roadmap
This is roadmap is based on my personal wants for the app by each version of the app rather than what a proper full scale app should have.

| Version | Update Title | Description |
| --- | --- | ------ |
| 0.0 | The beginning | No features will be implemented in version 0.0. |
| 0.1 | Starting Looks Update | The app will have a basic  UI for tracking data but no functionality |
| 0.2 | Basic Functionality Update | The app will be have basic functionality for persisting data tracking |
| 0.3 | Custom Data Setup Update | The app will allow users to freely customize |
| 0.4 | Title | Desc |
| 0.5 | Title | Desc |
| 0.6 | Title | Desc |
| 0.7 | Title | Desc |
| 0.8 | Title | Desc |
| 0.9 | Aesthetics Update | The app will be updated with better visuals if necessary |
| **1.0** | **Finished** | **At this point any finishing touches will be added and I will be satisfied with the app. So I will be able to consider my project finished** |
| 1.1 | Accessibility Update | On the rare case that I want to share this app on the play store I will want to add accessibility by this point |
