# Custom-Tracking-App

The plan is to make an android app that allows users to track whatever they want hence the custom aspect


## Roadmap
This is roadmap is based on my personal wants for the app by each version of the app rather than what a proper full scale app should have.
Note: In versions 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 data is used to refer to bowel movements as this idea originally came from a bowel movement tracking app

| Version | Update Title | Description |
| --- | --- | ------ |
| 0.0 | The beginning | No features will be implemented in version 0.0. |
| **0.1** | **Starting Looks** | **The app will have a basic  UI for tracking data but no functionality** |
| 0.2 | Basic Functionality | The app will be have basic functionality that allows users to input |
| 0.3 | Data Persistence | The app will have basic data persistence so the users can close to app and keep their data |
| 0.4 | Custom Data Setup | The app will allow users to freely customize what they want to track |
| 0.5 | Custom Data Tracking | The app will be able to track the different sorts of data a user sets up and allows for persisting data |
| 0.6 | Data View | Allows users to view different their data with more depth in multiple ways such as graphs |
| 0.7 | Presets | Add recommended presets for customizing data to be tracked |
| 0.8 | Aesthetics | The app will be updated with better visuals if necessary |
| 0.9 | Finishing Touches | Any finishing touches will be added at version 0.9 |
| **1.0** | **Finished** | **At this point any finishing touches will be added and I will be satisfied with the app. So I will be able to consider my project finished** |
| 1.1 | Accessibility Update | On the rare case that I want to share this app on the play store I will want to add accessibility by this point |
